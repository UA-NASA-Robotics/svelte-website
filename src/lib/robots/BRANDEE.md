# BRANDEE

BRANDEE was our 2024 competition robot, the first for the new competition goals. It was the design team's first attempt at a wheeled robot. The team placed 27th overall in regolith movement with 0.015 m^3 of regolith moved.

## Design

BRANDEE was a wheeled robot with a dual actuated arm bucket. It was 4 wheel drive, with each wheel powered by a REV neo motor through a 375:1 gearbox. The bucket was attached by a hybrid-length 4-bar linkage, where the Yaw and Attack depth were determined by linear actuators.
