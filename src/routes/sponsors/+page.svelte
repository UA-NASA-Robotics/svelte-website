<h2>Our Sponsors</h2>
<p>We would like to thank our sponsors for their generous support of our team. Without their help, we would not be able to compete in the NASA Robotic Mining Competition. We are grateful for their support and look forward to continuing our relationship with them.</p>

<h2>Our Team's Accomplishments</h2>
<p>The NASA Robotics Team allows University of Akron students to gain real-world experiential learning opportunities. Our team members are immersed in a work environment similar to the engineering industry, where they are challenged to incorporate their classroom knowledge into effective designs related to industry. These students benefit from competing with other universities from across the country and around the world. This allows the students to gain a real-world engineering education by designing, building and testing our prototypes based on particular specifications to ensure successful on-site event operations and promote critical problem solving. The skills our team members learn from these hands-on experiences cannot be taught in the classroom alone. Our students are then able to apply the skills discovered through research and hands-on training to their future engineering careers.</p>
<h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>
<p>We respectfully ask you to consider sponsoring our team. Our sponsors will receive high visibility through association with our team, recognized for our success in national competitions. Our team members are some of the most sought after engineers by industry because of the knowledge gained by participating on a design team, and sponsorship is a great recruitment tool to attract the next generation of engineers to your company.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration to learn more about the NASA Robotics Team and interest to help drive our success.</p>
