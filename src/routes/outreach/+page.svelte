				To help Replay this year, we modified toys to add an easy-to-actuate button into the
				circuit. The button is connected to a 3.5mm audio jack, which is plugged into the toy.
				Replay makes their own buttons by 3d printing the housing and soldering the wires to the
				audio jack. The large button makes it easy for kids with motor disabilities to activate the
				toy. Replay then distributes the toys to kids in need. They have said that the children love
				the independence that comes from being able to play with their toys be themselves!
