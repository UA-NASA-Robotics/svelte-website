				To help Replay this year, we modified toys to add an easy-to-actuate button into the
				circuit. The button is connected to a 3.5mm audio jack, which is plugged into the toy.
				Replay makes their own buttons by 3d printing the housing and soldering the wires to the
				audio jack. The large button makes it easy for kids with motor disabilities to activate the
				toy. Replay then distributes the toys to kids in need. They have said that the children love
				the independence that comes from being able to play with their toys be themselves!

	<h3>Firestone Vex Robotics Competition</h3>
	<p>
		Vex Robotics is a competition for middle and high school students. The students build robots to
		compete in a game. This year, the game was called Over Under. The robots must score tri-balls
		under a net, as well as climb a structure for end-game.
	</p>
	<h4>Our Roles</h4>
	<div class="flex-columns">
		<div class="seconds">
			<p>
				Our team was split throughout the different roles of the competition. We had a few people
				who were score-keepers, a few who were queue tables, and a few who were judges. Firestone
				High School also let us set up a table to show off our robot and talk to the students about
				our team.
