# Architecture overview

Stack

- SvelteKit ^2.27 (svelte ^5) with Vite ^7
- Adapter: @sveltejs/adapter-node (configured in svelte.config.js)
- TypeScript strict mode; svelte-check for diagnostics

Build and output

- npm run build invokes Vite/SvelteKit and adapter-node
- SvelteKit prerenders pages where export const prerender = true is set
- Output goes to build/ (client, server, prerendered) with Node handler
- npm run preview serves the built output for local validation

Rendering model

- CSR is enabled on most pages (export const csr = true) to support interactive Header/Footer and client features
- Prerendering is used for static pages like home and events (+page.ts sets prerender true) so the page HTML is generated at build time
- Pages needing form actions or server-only logic must not be prerendered (e.g., contact form)

App composition

- Global layout at src/routes/+layout.svelte includes Header and Footer and site-wide styles
- Routes under src/routes create pages; each route can have +page.svelte, +page.ts (prerender/csr flags), +page.server.{js,ts} (actions/load), +server.ts (API endpoints)
- Header navigation and Footer links are generated from src/components/Sitemap.ts
- Static files in static/ are available at the site root; use for immutable assets or files that shouldnâ€™t be processed by Vite (e.g., headerImages/*.jpg, document-files/*.pdf)

Key integration points

- Events API: src/routes/api/events/+server.ts fetches https://leboeuflasing.com/uaEvents.json and returns JSON to avoid CORS issues
- Contact form: src/routes/contact-us/+page.server.js uses src/components/Database.ts to POST to CouchDB (leboeuflasing.ddns.net:5984)
- Maps: src/components/ExpressMap.svelte embeds Google Maps via <iframe>

Aliases and paths

- $lib alias is provided by SvelteKit for src/lib
- Import images from $lib to benefit from Vite asset handling; static files should be referred to by absolute path (/headerImages/foo.jpg)
